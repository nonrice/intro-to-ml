# Intro to ML Course Materials
This repository contains all of the project source code from [Eric Xue's intro to ML class](https://www.sharegrow2.org/event-details/intro-to-machine-learning)

Meetings were held weekly over a period of 5 weeks. I was able to teach 6 students who regularly participated and used what they learned to create succesful projects!
